# Linear Algebra
## What is Linear Algebra?
### Overview
* ‚Äútranslating something residing in an m-dimensional space into a corresponding shape in an n-dimensional space‚Äù ‚Ä¶ like an object to a picture of an object, or vice versa; m and n can be equal here
* ‚Äúwill learn to work with matrices and vectors to understand the central concepts of ‚Äòlinear transformations,‚Äô ‚Äòeigenvalues,‚Äô and ‚Äòeigenvectors.‚Äô‚Äù

## Fundamentals
### Number Systems
* Complex numbers: a + b * I, where a and b are real numbers and I is ‚Äúthe imaginary unit‚Äù (sqrt(-1))
* real numbers: integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers
* imaginary numbers: complex numbers without a real component, like 0 + b*I
* so, take x^2 + 5 = 0. This also equals x^2 - (-5), which breaks out into (x + sqrt(5)I)(x - sqrt(5)I) - but wait, why is sqrt(-5) = sqrt(5) * I here? Is I constant? (Is there such a thing as a constant for an imaginary number?)
* I **is** a constant imaginary number üòÇ. Consider it a ‚Äúplaceholder‚Äù and that it‚Äôs accepted we can say sqrt(-x) = sqrt(x) * I.

### Implication and Equivalence
* Propositions are ‚Äúdeclarative sentences that are either true or false.‚Äù Must be true or false, cannot be both or ambiguous. (‚ÄúReiji Yurino is handsome.‚Äù)
* Implication: ‚ÄúIf this dish is a schnitzel, then it contains pork‚Äù is always true. But its converse: ‚ÄúIf this dish contains pork, then it is a schnitzel‚Äù is not always true!
* ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù is true, ‚ÄúIf Q then P‚Äù not necessarily true: ‚ÄúP entails Q‚Äù and ‚ÄúQ could entail P‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù is true, can write as P => Q; this is the ‚Äúimplication‚Äù symbol.
* Equivalence: If both ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf Q then P‚Äù are true, P => Q, Q => P, P and Q are ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù and can write as P <=> Q. This is the ‚Äúequivalence‚Äù symbol. P: Reiji is shorter than Tetsuo. Q: Tetsuo is taller than Reiji.

### Set Theory
* a ‚Äúset‚Äù is a collection of things; these things are called its ‚Äúelements‚Äù or ‚Äúobjects‚Äù
* example: the set of all even numbers from 1-10 contains these five elements: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* write it as {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
* also write it as {2n|n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
* So give the set a name: X = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
* element x belongs to set X; no idea how to type it, will use an E. x E X.
* Subsets: all elements of set X also belong to set Y, X is a subset. X C Y.

### Functions
* Images: if x1 is an element of set X, y1 is ‚Äúx1‚Äôs image under f in Y‚Äù - the element in Y that corresponds to x1 when put through function f. ‚Äúx1‚Äôs image under f in Y‚Äù is also written as f(x1).
* Domain and Range: Range is a (sub)set of Y; it‚Äôs the image of the set X under function f. Can also sometimes be called the image of f, but usually called the range of f. X is the domain of f. Y is the co-domain; it includes any values in Y that aren‚Äôt included in the range; a function‚Äôs range is a subset of its co-domain. CY vs =Y.
* Onto and 1:1 Functions: a function is ‚Äúonto‚Äù if its image (range?) is equal to its co-domain; all elements in the co-domain of an onto function are being mapped ‚Äúonto.‚Äù If no element in the co-domain can be mapped onto more than once, it‚Äôs 1:1. A function can be both onto and 1:1; in this case, each element has one and only one partner.
* Onto but not 1:1: X has 4 elements, Y has 3; one element in Y has two partners in X.
* 1:1 but not onto: X has 4 elements, Y has 5; even if each x maps onto a different y, there‚Äôs still a y left over that is not being mapped onto.
* Inverse Functions: f is an inverse of function g if: 1. g(f(xi)) = xi; 2. f(g(yj)) = yj. The two functions undo each other. f^-1: X -> Y. Also, if f has an inverse, f is both 1:1 and onto. And vice versa.
* Linear Transformations: if xi and xj are arbitrary elements of X, c is a real number, and f is a function from X to Y; f is a linear transformation from X to Y if 1. f(xi) + f(xj) = f(xi + xj); 2. cf(xi) = f(cxi).
* Example: 2x would make a linear transformation; test it against the two formulae. 2x - 1 would **not** make a linear transformation; test.

### Combinations and Permutations
* remember that (n over r) = (n! OVER (r!(n-r)!). This is the binomial coefficient. 

### Not All ‚ÄúRules for Ordering‚Äù Are Functions
* if there are multiple different ways to obey a command, it‚Äôs not a function.
